I'm a passionate Software Engineer and a recent graduate from Hendrix College (3.83 GPA) with hands-on experience in Software Engineering specifically DevOps, automation, and web development. I previously served as a Software Engineer at Acxiom LLC, where I led significant improvements in deployment automation and documentation processes, reducing deployment times and enhancing team efficiency.

My technical journey spans from building custom CI/CD pipelines to designing user-centric web interfaces. I've containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes, implemented automated workflows with Jenkins, and developed robust documentation systems that have been used by 100+ engineers at Acxiom.

Beyond technical skills, I bring a unique perspective through my diverse background and leadership experience as a Resident Assistant to over 300 college students and former Teaching Assistant (Lab Grader), where I helped guide 60+ computer science students through their programming journey.

I'm particularly passionate about:
