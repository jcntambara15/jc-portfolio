This project was inspired by the love of music. People sometimes want to enjoy their playlist across various music streaming platforms without having to recreate them. That's where this project comes in, and it enables everyone to be able to convert their playlist from one streaming platform to another - apple music to spotify, vice versa, etc. 

Visit [MixMatchPlay](https://github.com/cloud-leon/MixMatchPlay) to view the project's GitHub Repository.
